INSTRUCTIONS ON RUNNING THIS VERSION OF THE SCOUT SOFTWARE:

1. Copy this DEMO folder to anywhere on your system.
2. Run SCOUT.exe.  



BASICS OF USING THIS VERSION OF SCOUT:

Scout will start out calling you Master.  You can ask her to change your name if you like.

Scout currenlty uses the windows speech recognition software built into your PC.  She will be much better at understanding you if you go through the speech recognition 
training found in the control panel first.

To add and remove apps, simply place new app DLL's into the PLUGINS folder.  This demo includes a few to start off with.  An app library will be available when SCOUT leaves
beta (currently not even in alpha right now, this is strictly for the purposes of demoing the LOLInfo app).

Once the software has launched, say clearly into the microphone: "Hey Scout".  She will only reply to the wake-up commands if she is at least 90% sure you are calling to her.

To ask her about the plugins currently installed say "What can you do?", or "Command List".

Many other commands will work, these are just examples to get started.

When you are done talking with SCOUT, simply close the program, or you can say "Thanks Scout" to put her into sleeping mode.

If she doesn't understand something, she will say "What is...".  If using her in a loud room she may pick up a lot of background noise and try to make sense of it.  She attempts
to ignore speech while she is talking, but there are still some glitches in this feature.  As a general rule, when the microphone icon is visible on the application, SCOUT is 
listening.  Use a headset for the best quality.




USING THE LOLInfo APP COMMANDS:

To use the LOLInfo app, first set your summoner name with the "Set Summoner Name" command.

Then say "Match Stats" to get your current match analysis.
